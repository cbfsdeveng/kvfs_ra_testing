A very brief note about cpu profiling.
TODO(): more detail.

After the filesystem has exited, it will dump profile data to /tmp/fuse_kvfs.prof.
To analyze it:
google-pprof  ../src/fuse_kvfs /tmp/fuse_kvfs.prof
When google-pprof prompts, you can either just look at top cpu users:
(pprof) top100

or emit a fancy postscript cpu call graph:
(pprof) gv
