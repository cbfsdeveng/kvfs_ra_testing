Even if we don't evict directories, we need to be able to fault them back 
in when we mount a filesystem at a new server (fail-over, or for mounting a clone).

Do we want to handle the first-mount case separately? 
That could potentially involve faulting in the whole namespace, 
so doing it one dir at a time could be slow 
(unless somehow done very much in parallel).

For this stage of prototype, do we even need to demonstrate 
directory fault-in? If we don't evict dirs, we don't need to fault them back in.

Index is list of tarballs, with <inode,offset>.

When inode is a dir, the tarball contains dir contents (<name,inode> pairs)
