====== 02/16/17 mark and joe discussed the proxy manager in the context
		of how the TOA would interact with it

We also discussed the proxy manager and his relation to the TA/persister/evicter:
The proxy manager has a newObject method that takes a file system name and 
object name as a parameter, and returns a cachedObject.  

	The cachedObject has getName(), commit(statusObject*) and abort() methods.  
	A commit causes the associated file to be pushed, and gives the proxy 
	manager a statusObject to be updated when the push succeeds.  
	Note that these methods work as well for index and status objects as for tarballs.

	The persister constructor takes as parameters

	    a mounted kvfs (snapshot)
	    a log manager (for getting information about recent updates)
	    an index manager (for recording information about archived files)
	    a proxy manager (for creating and pushing objects)

	Persister.snapshot(minXid,maxXid)

	    uses the log manager to get information about the selected updates
	    reads the kvfs snapshot to get data and metadata
	    uses the proxy manager to create a tarball
	    uses the index manager to create an index entry describing the tarball
	    unmounts the snapshot when it is done
	    instantiates, initializes and returns a status object for the snapshot
