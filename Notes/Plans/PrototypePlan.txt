Opportunity Investigations

	What was the performance with a caching solution,
	and why was it inadequate/unacceptable?
		(what kinds of numbers do we have to hit)

	We need sample genomes to know what the data looks like.
	What is the creation scenario?
		(how big a write-back cache do we need)
	What is the appropriate benchmark?

	What are the post-creation use scenarios?
	How often?
		(how good is the locality?
		 how critical are ls, grep?)
	What are appropriate benchmarks?

	
Technical Investigations

	KV research (3-6w)
		What are the available KV candidates?
		How good are their tool-kits?
		How tied are they to particular hardware?
		What has momentum and buzz?
		Is anybody talking this kind of use?
		get and play with the likely ones.
		choose one or two for prototyping
		
		[PP should be on-board to do this]

	Tarball design (3-6w)
		representation (easy)
		tiering out to 2ndary storage
		tiering back to 1ary storage
		remote read optimizations
		synnergy w/cbfs
		define scope of prototype effort

		[VP must be on-board to do this]

Prototyping

	KV prototyping (1-2w)
		performance measurements at scale
		estimates of required memory
		estimates of required h/w cost
	
	FUSE prototyping (2-4w)
		goal: mine-sweep the design
		goal: a platform for preliminary performance measurement
		include functional validation suite

	FUSE + KV performance (2-4w)
		include performance suite(s)
		
	flush to tarball (2-4w)
		goal: minesweep the design
		goal: performance vs direct write to back-end

	load from tarball (4-8w)
		goal: minesweep the design
		goal: performance of ls and grep

	??? is there any reason to prototype direct posix back-end ???
		No:	It is not a high performance plan
			It is primarily a transparency save
			The technical risk is very low

Planning:
	
	functionality/performance demo platform	(2-4w)

	product proposal (1-2w)
		general product description
		achievable create performance
		achievable reuse performance
		per station hardware cost
		proposed revenue model
	
	development proposal (2-4w)
		proposed h/w
		proposed kvs
		proposed s/w architecture
		proposed s/w development plan

Crude Schedule Estimation:
	Investigation	 6-12sw
	Prototyping	11-22sw
	Planning	 5-10sw
			------
			22-44sw

	staffing	time	date (start 10/1/14)
	--------	----	----
	1 x .5		44-88w	2/16 ... way too long
	2 x .5		22-44w	6/15
	3 x .5		17-33w	4/15 ... this should be our goal
	4 x .5		11-22w	2/15 ... probably unrealistic
