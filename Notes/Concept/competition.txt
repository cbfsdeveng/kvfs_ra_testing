We may be able to offer lower latency (due to our use of KVS and a 
possible libC bypass) but the high order bits seem quite similar to our 
own project (full Posix w/local FUSE with optional local disk cache that 
batches updates into large multi-file in-cloud objects, doing encryption 
locally before the data hits the wire).

I think we have some cool ideas that they don't ... but I saw enough to 
earn my respect.  This is not a research or hobby project. Things that 
caught my attention:

  * they do OSX as well as Linux
  * S3 and Google Cloud Storage (no surprise given the founders' history)

  * strong data integrity ... presumably per-file/chunk checksums,
    probably a good idea
  * what are work load adaptive heuristics?  These pertain to the
    batching of cloud updates?
  * "as many concurrent readers and writers as your object store can
    handle" with "atomic file/directory rename and creation" but I do
    not see any explicit mention of read-after-write-consistency for
    independent clients.
  * multiple file systems per bucket ... I guess we could do that, but
    why?  I thought buckets were cheap?
  * live rekey ... (I assume this means change of encryption key) ...
    using EC2 IAM roles (we would need similar tricks to do our in-cloud
    garbage collection)
  * "no data-dependent branches/indices" to "protect against cache
    timing attacks" ... perhaps I am just an old geezer, but this sounds
    like a pretty strange "geek brag" ... but their background is security.
  * it looks like a very small start-up that has been doing this for
    about 18 months with a ~3mo cadence (and flurry of fixes after each)

They are local.  Perhaps CB would like to talk to them?
